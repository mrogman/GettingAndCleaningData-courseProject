# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

Authored by: Matt Rogman

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the extraction and cleaning of a raw data set collected using a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) during human physical activity. Visit the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for more information on this data set.

The source data can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

*See CodeBook.md for a description of the variables, the data, and transformations performed on the dataset*

## Assignment

#### Directions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
